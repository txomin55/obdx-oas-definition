## Introduction

Welcome to the Dog trainer API documentation! This early access release of the Dog trainer API allows you to save your
dog training data listings in a simple, programmatic way, using conventional HTTP requests.

The API documentation will start with a general overview about the design and technology that has been implemented,
followed by reference information about specific endpoints.

## Requests

The Dog trainer API conforms to the REST Architectural Standards. Entities are represented as resources, each one with
an URL and unique identifier, and can be manipulated with the GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE HTTP methods. All
methods with the exception of POST are idempotent.
